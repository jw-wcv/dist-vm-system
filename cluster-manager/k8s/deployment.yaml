#
# Description: Kubernetes deployment configuration for distributed compute workers
#
# This file defines a Kubernetes deployment that manages distributed compute
# worker pods in the cluster. It ensures high availability and scalability
# for the distributed processing workloads.
#
# Configuration:
#   - Deployment name: distributed-compute
#   - Replicas: 3 (ensures 3 worker pods are always running)
#   - Container: compute-worker using distributed-compute:latest image
#   - Selector: app=compute-node (for service discovery)
#
# Inputs: None (uses default Kubernetes configuration)
# Outputs:
#   - 3 running compute worker pods
#   - Automatic pod replacement on failure
#   - Load balancing through associated service
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Kubernetes cluster
#   - distributed-compute:latest Docker image
#   - service.yaml (for network access)
