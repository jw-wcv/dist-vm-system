# service.yaml
#
# Description: Kubernetes service configuration for distributed compute workers
#
# This file defines a Kubernetes service that provides network access to the
# distributed compute worker pods. It enables load balancing and service
# discovery for the compute workloads.
#
# Configuration:
#   - Service name: compute-service
#   - Selector: app=compute-node (matches deployment labels)
#   - Port mapping: External port 80 -> Container port 8080
#   - Protocol: TCP
#
# Inputs: None (uses default Kubernetes configuration)
# Outputs:
#   - Load-balanced access to compute worker pods
#   - Service discovery via compute-service name
#   - Network abstraction for pod communication
#
# Dependencies:
#   - deployment.yaml (for compute-node pods)
#   - ingress.yaml (for external access)
