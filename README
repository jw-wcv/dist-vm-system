# Distributed VM System

This project provides a distributed compute framework utilizing multiple VMs orchestrated through a central GUI. The system allows distributed processing of workloads, task delegation, and filesystem synchronization across VMs.

## Features
- Distributed task execution across worker VMs.
- Unified GUI interface using Electron.
- Kubernetes and Terraform-based orchestration.
- GPU passthrough for compute-intensive tasks.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jw-wcv/dist-vm-system.git
